{\bf EMAT10001 Exercise Sheet 14.}\\[1cm]{} Conor Houghton 2014-02-02

\subsubsection*{Exercise sheet}

The difference between the work sheet and the exercise sheet is that
the solutions to the exercise sheet won't be given and the problems
are designed to be more suited to working on on your own, though you
are free to discuss them in the work shop if you finish the work sheet
problems. Selected problems from the exercise sheet will be requested
as part of the continual assessment portfolio.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Revise differentiating; find $df/dx$ of
\begin{enumerate}
\item $f(x)=1-\cos^2{x}$.
\item $f(x)=1/(1-x)$.
\end{enumerate}

\item Calculate a Taylor series for $\cos{x}$. 

\item Plot the behavior of different truncated Taylor series for
  $\cos{x}$ and compare them to $\cos{x}$ itself, truncate after one,
  two, four, eight and ten terms and plot over $-2\pi$ to $2\pi$.

\item We saw the natural log in last week's problem sheet, $\ln{x}=y$
  means $x=e^y$. now prove using the chain rule that
\begin{equation}
\frac{d}{dx}\ln{x}=\frac{1}{x}
\end{equation}

\item Calculate the Taylor series for $\ln{(1+t)}$ around $t=0$.

\item Calculate a Taylor series for $1/(1-x)$. Test the accuracy of the
  series after three terms for $x=0$, $x=0.5$, $x=0.75$ and $x=0.9$.

\item Write a program to implement the Euler method and the second and
  fourth order Runge-Kutta methods for solving differential equations
  for $\dot{y}=f(y)$; use these to solve the equation $\dot{P}=P(1-P)$
  mentioned last week and check the error of the various methods.

\end{enumerate}
